Welcome to PetArtLab where you will find handmade gifts for dogs and their humans. We are big fans of greyhounds but do offer items for other breeds and species. On the blog, we share info we've learned along the way while caring for our grey. We hope you find it useful!

We hope you enjoy our greyt adventures and makes! Please join us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/petartlab), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/petartlab) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/petartlab) to see what we are up to!

We have a sister shop that offers handmade gifts related to science called [PlushArtLab] (https://www.etsy.com/shop/plushartlab). You can visit the PetArtLab shop [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/petartlab).
