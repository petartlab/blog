Hi! Iâ€™m Faith and I'm a greyhound living in London with my mom and dad. I spend most of my time sleeping and pawing for more pets. My dad gives the best pets but my mom tries. Mom thought it would be fun to share the adventures we go on together. She does the writing but I help lots with creative ideas! 

My mom is an embroiderer and she makes [sciencey things](https://www.plushartlab.etsy.com). More recently, she's started making things inspired by [me](https://www.petartlab.etsy.com). 

Feel welcome to join us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/petartlab) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/petartlab) to see what we are up to!
