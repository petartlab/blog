If you live in the city, your grey will end up walking on sidewalks and mostly paved roads. Because they are used to walking and racing on softer surfaces, greyhounds seem to suffer from various issues with their paws once they are rehomed, such as cuts, foreign objects getting embedded, and corns. We will share more in the future but for now here are the basics we use to keep Faith's paws as healthy as possible:

* [Hibiscrub](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001AV4C20/ref=sns_myd_detail_page)- we use this diluted in a bucket of water to wash her feet after muddy walks. 

* [Musher's Secret](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mushers-Secret-Protection-60-Gram/dp/B0002IJQDC/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=musher%27s&qid=1629299437&s=pet-supplies&sr=1-2)- we apply this to her paws when they are dry.
