When Faith first arrived home, she had very dry skin. Some greys seem to have drier skin than others, just like humans. To help with the flaky skin, we've tried several supplements and they seem to be helping. Here are the ones currently in use:

* [Coconut oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IARWA6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- half a tablespoon per meal
* [Omega3 fish oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086RTMN2L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- 1 capsule per meal
* [Evening Primrose oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009M3O0ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- 1 capsule per meal

Aside from addressing her skin, we are also using a couple of other supplements to help with her joints and teeth.
* [Jointsure](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B078XHF8GM/ref=sns_myd_detail_page)- the vet recommended the use of a joint supplement as a preventative since retired racers often develop joint issues as they age.  We use this instead of [YuMove](https://yumove.co.uk/).
* [Kelp powder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I9WWUH2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- this is supposed to soften plaque to help removal during brushing. We use this instead of [PlaqueOff](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ProDen-Plaque-Off-Food-Supplement/dp/B0047VWPNI/ref=sr_1_5_mod_primary_new?dchild=1&keywords=plaque+off&qid=1629302020&rdc=1&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=8-5).
