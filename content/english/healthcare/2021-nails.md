Trimming your dog's nails can be daunting, especially if they have black nails. This makes it hard to see where the quick (blood flow) ends so it's scary to use a nail trimmer. But trimming your dog's nails is important because it can affect their posture. Many people suggested the use of a dremel for black nails, so we got a [corded dremel](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0078LENZC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The ones made for pet nails seem popular but they are less powerful, which can be both good and bad. It's good since it's quieter but it's bad because it's slower to trim. They are also portable since they tend to be battery operated. You can get cordless dremels but they are either more expensive or less powerful. 

Faith had no issues with us handling her paws, which is not the case with all dogs. However, she did not like the look of the dremel and the noise it made. So, first we got her acclimated to the noise, then the feel when the dremel touched her nail, then we started with trimming one nail at a time multiple times a day. Each interaction was kept short and pleasant with plenty of liver cake treats and she was happy. Now, she willingly lays on her side for us to trim all her nails in one session. Of course, she gets her chicken feet afterwards as a treat! This is repeated every 1-2 weeks. 

If you are brave or feel comfortable using a nail clipper, the [Mikki nail clipper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00N0Y2NBC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) was recommended by our kennel.
