Many greyhound owners say greys are untrainable because they aren't food oriented. Fortunately for us, Faith turned out to be very food motivated! As a result, I was able to train her to do certain things that make our lives easier. For example, asking her to lie down, and roll on her side was helpful to position her for nail trimming. Another useful one was asking her to get on her bed. After training her for awhile, I realised that Faith loves her training time. She is eager to have her session and if we don't do it on time, she starts whining and staring me down. This made me think that she enjoys the mental stimulation so I started looking into enrichment toys.

We've tried these so far and she's enjoyed them all:

[Puzzle toy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07239T47Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- we got the intermediate one to start with. She had trouble grabbing hold of the bone lids, so we added a string to each and that's made it easy for her to remove.

[Plush puzzle toy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0002I0O60/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- we got the medium size one and she loves digging out the squirrels and flinging them everywhere. 

[Kong rewards ball](https://fetch.co.uk/kong-rewards-ball-treat-dispensing-dog-toy-large-448503011)- I've started putting in larger treats inside so that it's a bit harder for her to get the small treats out when the ball rolls about.

I don't know how other greyhounds are but I found Faith is easily discouraged if she doesn't know what I want from her. I found capturing to be the best technique for training and keeping the sessions short is important to keep things positive. She is still completely unfocused once we are outside the house so we have long ways to go!
