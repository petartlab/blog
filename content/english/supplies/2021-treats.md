We've tried giving Faith several kinds of treats, some more gruesome than others. 

Here are some of the hits:

* [Ostrich Bone](https://www.petplanet.co.uk/p35900/antos_ostrich_dino_bone.aspx)- these are very useful for cleaning teeth. You can also get them [here](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/large-ostrich-bone/?v=79cba1185463).

* [Training treats](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/pure-training-treats-dog-treats/?v=79cba1185463)- I've found these small treats useful to put in puzzles and kongs.

* [Chicken feet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hollings-653775/dp/B00EDR4L9C/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=hollings+chicken+feet&qid=1629308348&rdc=1&sr=8-2)- she can't resist these but they look disgusting.

* [Sprats](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01LCXWNKI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- make sure you keep these double bagged and sealed, they stink but Faith loves them.


* [Liver Cake](https://www.hearingdogs.org.uk/training-our-puppies/dog-treat-recipes/liver-cake/)- picture above, these I make myself sort of following the linked recipe. I don't add any milk and swap flour for ground up oats. She loves them and they are useful to have on hand as treats for doing her nails and teeth. 

Moderate response:

* [Yak chew](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dog_treats_chews/chew_sticks/hard_chew_sticks/695314)- We got these based on the [Magnus YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/degsgunn) recommendation but I would say she's less enthusiastic about them over time. One useful tip is when you have a small piece left at the end, you can microwave it and it will puff up. I let it cool then give it to her and it's like a big cracker.
