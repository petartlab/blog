About a year ago, we adopted a retired racing greyhound. I wanted to document our journey because seeing other people's experiences helped us make the decision and we want to see more retired racers homed! 

Meet Faith! She is a black female greyhound, and she will be 5 years old in August. "Faith" was part of her racing name.
 
Faith was rehomed through the Greyhound Trust branch, [Croftview Kennels](https://www.greyhoundtrustharvel.co.uk/). The search began mid 2019 and involved numerous visits to speak to the staff and find the right fit. After many delays due to COVID-19, Faith chose us and she came home in May 2020. The staff at Croftview Kennels are amazingly helpful and knowledgeable. They will help you find the hound that is looking for you.

If you have a grey and want to look into their history, have a look at [Greyhound Data](https://www.greyhound-data.com/). You will neeed to register but once you do, you can find out a lot about your hound. Racing history, their mom and dad, their siblings and more! If you are lucky, you might even find a video.
