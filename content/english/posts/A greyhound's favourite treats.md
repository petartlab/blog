We've tried giving several different kinds of treats, some more gruesome than others. 

Here are some of the hits:

* [Ostrich Bone](https://www.petplanet.co.uk/p35900/antos_ostrich_dino_bone.aspx)- these are very useful for cleaning teeth. You can also get them [here](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/large-ostrich-bone/?v=79cba1185463).

* [Chicken feet](https://amzn.to/3zR9tQ4)- she can't resist these but they look disgusting.

* [Sprats](https://amzn.to/3BOHp03)- make sure you keep these double bagged and sealed, they stink.

* [Liver Cake](https://www.hearingdogs.org.uk/training-our-puppies/dog-treat-recipes/liver-cake/)- picture above, these I make following the linked recipe. I don't add any milk and swap flour for ground up oats. She loves them and they are useful to have on hand as treats for doing nails and teeth. 

* [Dental Sticks](https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/lilys-kitchen-woofbrush-natural-dental-large-breed-adult-dog-chews-7-pack)-they are like candy.

* [Rabbit Ears with Hair](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/rabbit-ears-with-hair/?v=79cba1185463)- she loves them as much as chicken feet.

* [Natural Beef Tails Long Lasting Dog Chew](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/beef-tails-for-dogs/?v=79cba1185463)- first time she threw it up. Now we soak it in water overnight to soften it and she can have it the next day, disappears quickly.

* [Premium Lamb Pizzle Twists](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/premium-lamb-pizzle-twists/?v=79cba1185463)- doesn't require soaking in water, lasts awhile.

Moderate response:

* [Yak chew](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dog_treats_chews/chew_sticks/hard_chew_sticks/695314)- we got these based on the [Magnus YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/degsgunn) recommendation but I would say she's less enthusiastic about them over time. One useful tip is when you have a small piece left at the end, you can microwave it and it will puff up. Let it cool completely and it's like a big cracker.

* [Training treats](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/pure-training-treats-dog-treats/?v=79cba1185463)- these small treats are useful to put in puzzles and kongs.

* [Pure Salmon Sticks](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/pure-salmon-sticks-50g/?v=79cba1185463)- she will take it but it's not a favourite. 

* [Venison Tendon](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/venison-bundle/?v=79cba1185463)- she threw it back up. Softening it in water before might be helpful but we haven't tried it.

* [Pure Pat√© Variety Pack](https://www.jrpetproducts.com/shop/pure-pate-variety-pack-5x400g-1-x-chicken-turkey-salmon-beef-lamb/?v=79cba1185463)- not as effective as homemade liver treats.

* Most other mass produced treats
