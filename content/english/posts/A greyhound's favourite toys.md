Here are some of our hound's favourites: 

[Cleo caterpillar](https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/soft-toys-and-teddy-bears/190cm-cleo-the-caterpillar/p/122783)- seems like all greys love this toy. It's gigantic so expect it to take up some space. Our hound likes to use it as a bolster now but she used to drag it around, bite it, and shake it about!

[Kong](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KONG-Classic-Durable-Natural-Rubber/dp/B0002AR0I8/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=kong+large&amp;qid=1698932864&amp;sr=8-5&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=190d448ce5e557d7bad7b9d3dfebe7c3&camp=1634&creative=6738)- we got the large size (10cm) and she enjoys digging out the food but she does give up rather easily and stops trying when it becomes difficult to get a stubborn piece out. 

[Kong stuff-a-ball](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KONG-Stuff-Ball-Dog-Toy/dp/B0002DHO1S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3R4BFH70XVN97&amp;keywords=Kong+stuff-a-ball&amp;qid=1698932899&amp;sprefix=kong+stuff-a-ball%252Caps%252C135&amp;sr=8-1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2bb863040e15a21e032c1801f2519b3f&camp=1634&creative=6738)- I don't like this one as much, the notches make it difficult to clean.

[Tennis balls](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KONG-Squeak-Balls-Medium-Pack/dp/B071HGXP67/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2TXDZ11CGGFA4&amp;keywords=Kong+tennis+balls&amp;qid=1698932929&amp;sprefix=kong+tennis+balls%252Caps%252C86&amp;sr=8-5&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=95ce5669f6e9fb4d2c13afb44504a347&camp=1634&creative=6738)- this is fun to throw around the garden for her to chase. She will hold it in her mouth making it squeak while running at high speed! 

[Squeaky bear](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KONG-Internal-Knotted-Stuffing-Assorted/dp/B00B4UR0G2/ref=sr_1_11?crid=3EI7OIKSZLTPO&amp;keywords=Kong+squeaky+bear+medium&amp;qid=1698933065&amp;sprefix=kong+squeaky+bear+medium%252Caps%252C71&amp;sr=8-11&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d862b88d91d1a5412ebe3bd782ba48c0&camp=1634&creative=6738)- she liked playing with this early on when she was settling down, now not so much. 

[Octopus plush](https://www.kentgreyhoundrescue.com/product/octopus-family-dog-toys/)- this one we don't have but other greys seem to love them.
