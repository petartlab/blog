It can be daunting to figure out what you need when you are preparing for your hound. Here are the supplies we got, hopefully you find them helpful. 
 
## **Food** ##
Food was chosen based on the recommendation list from the kennel, and the food evaluation website, [All about dog food](https://www.allaboutdogfood.co.uk/). Based on the list, we ordered the [Rocco classic pure beef](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/wet_dog_food/rocco/rocco_classic/1005046) and the [Step up to naturals chicken and sweet potato adult dog food](https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/step-up-to-naturals-chicken-and-sweet-potato-grain-free-adult-dog-food-14kg-7128739p--1). The kennels usually recommend that you keep the food the same, at least initially, to minimise change. If you want to change it, you can do so incrementally over time.
 
## **Food bowl and stand** ##
We got two [bowls](https://amzn.to/3BNWMG7) and a [wall mounted bowl holder](https://www.bigpaws.co/products/wall-mounted-dog-bowls), but the stand types seem popular, either as a [single](https://amzn.to/3zTNdov) or a [double](https://amzn.to/3ngiu1H). You can also get these from the Greyhound Trust Shop ([single](https://greyhoundtruststore.com/collections/pet-greyhound-feed/products/1-bowl-raissed-feeder), and [double](https://greyhoundtruststore.com/collections/pet-greyhound-feed/products/2-bowl-raissed-feeder.)).
 
For reference, the one sold by the trust has measurements: 1400ml stainless steel bowl, 34 cm height x 44 cm wide x 10 cm depth for the single. You may want to check the one sold elsewhere to make sure the size is what you want. The stand type might be better if you want to take it with you on holiday. Since our stand is attached to the wall, we take the bowls with us and have not had any trouble finding a makeshift stand in the accomodation. 
 
## **House Collar, ID tag** ##
There is so much variety on the market, it's really hard to choose. After trial and error, we settled on a [small plastic ID tag](https://amzn.to/3yLvrCE) with our address and phone numbers and saying she is microchipped. We tried a larger stainless steel tag but it irritated her skin and caused fur loss in the area where the tag made contact. Other owners say that the collars themselves can cause fur loss too, so some opt for satin lined collars, which works for some hounds. It's up to you which one you get since there is so much choice, but the kennels suggested a medium size nylon collar (1.5in wide) to hold the ID tag. Some dogs lose their tags so you could get an [embroidered collar](https://www.custompetcollars.co.uk/) but they will take several weeks to arrive.

## **Bed** ##
After searching high and low for a bed that is easy to clean and will last, we settled on [Tuffies](https://www.tuffies.co.uk/browse/c-Dog-Mattress-beds-and-covers-6) at the kennel's recommendation (picture shown above). The price is high but a year later, we can recommend them. Unlike most, they keep their shape and are easy to clean. You can get them made to measure and also ask them to add a handle to make it easier to maneuver when cleaning and hoovering. It doesn't cost more to get it custom made to your measurements because they make them to order anyway. An extra fleece blanket on top stops them from digging into their bed. 

## **Lead and muzzle** ##
We purchased [this lead](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/124196094666?hash=item1ceaaa02ca:g:N3wAAOSww9xZBftn).
They are attached by a buckle and not a clip/trigger attachment that could break, and are similar to what the Greyhound Trust sell [here](https://greyhoundtruststore.com/collections/collars-leads-harnesses/products/utility-leather-collar-and-lead-set). You can also find it from other suppliers, including the [Greyhound Superstore](https://www.greyhoundsuperstore.co.uk/product-category/collars-leads/?c=04007ae3e449). You want to make sure it's the right fit for your dog and that the lead attachment is secure. A year later, the one we purchased is still in use but it does tend to soften over time and the leather is showing some cracks. Treating the leather might help.

The muzzle was bought from the kennel so that the staff could fit it to her properly. You might want to do the same for the lead if you are worried about fit.
 
## **Coat** ##
We initially purchased a 28 inch Cosipet hunter coat from [here](https://www.hyperdrug.co.uk/cosipet-greyhound-hunter-dog-coat-green/productinfo/GREYHUNTER). Over time, we discovered that the poppers at the front tend to pop open during sniff sessions. Since then, we've purchased two new coats from Lilypeeps. A 26 inch [shower mac](https://lilypeeps.co.uk/product/greyhound-shower-mac-with-hood/) for warmer rainy weather and a 26 inch [waterproof fleece coat](https://lilypeeps.co.uk/product/greyhound-waterproof-raincoat-fleece-lined/) for colder wet weather. Both are great but over time some threads unravelled, this was easily fixed with a needle and thread. Your dog might be a different size depending on the supplier even though most measure from the base of neck to the start of tail. One thing to keep in mind is that some greys lose their bum fur in the Winter, so you might want to make sure this is covered from the cold. Their bellies are also bald so you may want coverage there too. The Lilypeeps waterproof fleece has a panel that covers the tummy, whereas the cosipet doesn't.

## **Health insurance** ##
I think you get 4 weeks Pet Plan insurance when you adopt through Greyhound Trust but seem to remember something about a grace period where if something happens in the first two weeks after you take out a new insurance policy, it may not be covered. I may be wrong about this so please check and make sure you get the new insurance in time, perhaps before your free one ends. Popular insurers seem to be [Animal Friends](https://www.animalfriends.co.uk/), [Pet Plan](https://www.petplan.co.uk/) and [Bought by Many](https://www.boughtbymany.com/) but it would need looking into to find the best policy for you. Some things to consider are whether you want lifetime and or dental cover. It would also be a good idea to find a greyhound saavy vet in your area and sign up, especially if you want to use flea/tick/worm treatments that require vet prescriptions.
