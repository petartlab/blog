To help with dry flaky skin, we've tried several supplements and they seem to be helping. Here are the ones currently in use:

* [Coconut oil](https://amzn.to/3kV4A1S)- half a tablespoon per meal
* [Omega3 fish oil](https://amzn.to/3tusfuc)- 1 capsule per meal
* [Evening Primrose oil](https://amzn.to/3zVOdJ0)- 1 capsule per meal
* Oats- half a tablespoon per meal

We also use supplements for joints and teeth:

* [Jointsure](https://amzn.to/3DSQE1h)- the vet recommended the use of a joint supplement as a preventative since retired racers often develop joint issues as they age.  We use this instead of [YuMove](https://yumove.co.uk/), which seems very popular.
* [Kelp powder](https://amzn.to/3DUVvit)- this is supposed to soften plaque to help removal during brushing or bone chewing. We use this instead of [PlaqueOff](https://amzn.to/38LbEbZ).
