We adopted our greyhound through the [Greyhound Trust] (https://www.greyhoundtrust.org.uk/) but there are many other groups that do an amazing job rehoming hounds. 

If you have a grey and want to look into their history, have a look at [Greyhound Data](https://www.greyhound-data.com/). You will neeed to register but once you do, you can find out a lot about your hound. Racing history, their mom and dad, their siblings and more. If you are lucky, you might even find videos and photos!
