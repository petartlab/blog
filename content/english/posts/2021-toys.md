Here are some of our hound's favourites: 

[Cleo caterpillar](https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/soft-toys-and-teddy-bears/190cm-cleo-the-caterpillar/p/122783)- seems like all greys love this toy. It's gigantic so expect it to take up some space. Our hound likes to use it as a bolster now but she used to drag it around, bite it, and shake it about!

[Kong](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dog_toys_dog_training/kongs/kong/139212)- we got the large size (10cm) and she enjoys digging out the food but she does give up rather easily and stops trying when it becomes difficult to get a stubborn piece out. 

[Kong stuff-a-ball](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dog_toys_dog_training/kongs/dental_dog_toy/139262)- I don't like this one as much, the notches make it difficult to clean.

[Tennis balls](https://fetch.co.uk/kong-air-dog-air-kong-squeakers-balls-medium-3-pack-dog-toy-85430011)- this is fun to throw around the garden for her to chase. She will hold it in her mouth making it squeak while running at high speed! 

[Squeaky bear](https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dog_toys_dog_training/kongs/special/490974)- she liked playing with this early on when she was settling down, now not so much. 

[Octopus plush](https://www.kentgreyhoundrescue.com/product/octopus-family-dog-toys/)- this one we don't have but other greys seem to love them.
