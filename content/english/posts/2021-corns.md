Our hound suffers from corns. Here are some things that have helped so far:

* Natural removal- we have found the best is not to use tools to remove the corn but allow it to get bigger and eventually protrude from the paw. It will start to separate from the healthy tissue and you could encourage this when you apply the Cerave cream on the corn with your fingernails. The corn will come out on its own. At that point, you could continue applying the Cerave cream 4 times a day.

* [Cerave SA cream](https://amzn.to/38PvoLn)- apply this on the corns (or where the corn was) 4 times a day.

Using the above method, we managed to get right paw corn much smaller. It started out as big as the left paw corn, which we are continuing to work on.ÃŸ

Possibly helpful:

* [Epsom salt](https://amzn.to/3yUR7w2)- many people soak their greys' paws in epsom salt solution for several hours, then hull the corn out using dental tools. We've tried this as well but didn't notice much difference between soaking in water vs salt solution. Perhaps this depends on the salt concentration and ours was diluted too much. 

We've also tried many remedies which failed, including:

* [Colloidal Silver 20 ppm](https://amzn.to/3yR1pNK)- observed no effect.

* [3M silver duct tape](https://amzn.to/2WViN6M)- this was useless because it would not stay on for long. [Gorilla tape](https://amzn.to/3yLL8K0) worked better but slips and moves off the corn. 

* [Musher's Secret](https://amzn.to/38RXplq)- this moisturises pads temporarily but doesn't seem to affect corns.

Untested remedies:

* Nail Polish- some people apply this on the corn possibly to dry it out.
