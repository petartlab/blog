Our hound is food motivated and enthusiastic about learning, so we started introducing enrichment toys.

We've tried these so far and she's enjoyed them all:

[Puzzle toy](https://amzn.to/3nbyRw8)- we got the intermediate one to start with. She had trouble grabbing hold of the bone lids, so we added a string to each and that's made it easy for her to remove. 

[Plush puzzle toy](https://amzn.to/3jSBkti)- we got the medium size one and she likes digging out the squirrels and flinging them everywhere. 

[Kong rewards ball](https://fetch.co.uk/kong-rewards-ball-treat-dispensing-dog-toy-large-448503011)- You can put larger treats inside to make it harder to get out when the ball rolls about.
