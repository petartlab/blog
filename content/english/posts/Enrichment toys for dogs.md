Our hound is food motivated and enthusiastic about learning, so we started introducing enrichment toys.

We've tried these so far and she's enjoyed them all:

[Puzzle toy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07239T47Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=petartlab-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07239T47Y&amp;linkId=315bd2f0120ef39ab3a4330da5d6eb15&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=7862a66bc7926676e35404c887611c14&camp=1634&creative=6738)- we got the intermediate one to start with. She had trouble grabbing hold of the bone lids, so we added a string to each and that's made it easy for her to remove. 

[Plush puzzle toy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0002I0O60/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=petartlab-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0002I0O60&amp;linkId=03bf1ed2d132a0ac3da215caccc4e0ff&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=363587c7ec99aafe8f9c856620d91492&camp=1634&creative=6738)- we got the medium size one and she likes digging out the squirrels and flinging them everywhere. 

[Kong rewards ball](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KONG-Rewards-Large-Treat-Dispensing/dp/B07HSJ1TSQ/ref=sr_1_2_mod_primary_new?keywords=kong+rewards+ball&amp;qid=1698929943&amp;s=pet-supplies&amp;sbo=RZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D&amp;sr=1-2&_encoding=UTF8&tag=petartlab07-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c4f52b58f7d99c08f5d9215e47accd95&camp=1634&creative=6738)- You can put larger treats inside to make it harder to get out when the ball rolls about.
