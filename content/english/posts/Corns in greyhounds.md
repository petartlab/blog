Our hound suffers from corns. Here are some things that have helped so far:

* Natural removal- we have found the best is not to use tools to remove the corn but allow it to get bigger and eventually protrude from the paw. It naturally separates from the healthy tissue and you could encourage this when you apply the Cerave cream on the corn with your fingernails. The corn will eventually come out on its own. At that point, you could continue applying the Cerave cream 4 times a day. 

* [Cerave SA cream](https://amzn.to/38PvoLn)- applied to corns (or where the corn was) 4 times a day.


* [Therapaw boots](https://amzn.to/2Yzl08I)- size TD, used for every walk on front two paws. Note they are sold individually. We use [newborn socks](https://amzn.to/3E02zKR) underneath with a small hole made for the dew claws to prevent rubbing. This has stopped her limping and made her much happier to walk. [Hunnyboots](https://hunnyboots.com/) are a stylish popular alternative but sizing and customs charges made us try the therapaws.

Using the above method, we managed to get right paw corn much smaller. It started out as big as the left paw corn, which we are continuing to work on albeit with slow progress.

Possibly helpful:

* [Epsom salt](https://amzn.to/3yUR7w2)- many people soak their greys' paws in epsom salt solution for several hours, then hull the corn out using [dental tools](https://amzn.to/3BQoSAv) or a [root elevator](https://amzn.to/3jYxzD3). We've tried this as well but didn't notice much difference between soaking in water vs salt solution. Perhaps this depends on the salt concentration and ours was diluted too much. 

We've also tried many remedies which failed, including:

* [Colloidal Silver 20 ppm](https://amzn.to/3yR1pNK)- observed no effect.

* [3M silver duct tape](https://amzn.to/2WViN6M)- this was useless because it would not stay on for long. [Gorilla tape](https://amzn.to/3yLL8K0) worked better but slips and moves off the corn. 

* [Musher's Secret](https://amzn.to/38RXplq)- this moisturises pads temporarily but doesn't seem to affect corns.

Untested remedies:

* Nail Polish- some people apply this on the corn possibly to dry it out.
