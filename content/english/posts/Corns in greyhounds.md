If your greyhound starts limping (goes lame), you might want to first check your dog's paw pads for corns. One way to check for this is to rub a little bit of toothpaste to see an outline of the corn. 

Our hound suffers from corns. Here are some things that have helped so far:

* Natural removal- we have found the best is not to use tools to remove the corn but allow it to get bigger and eventually protrude from the paw. It naturally separates from the healthy tissue and you could encourage this when you apply the Cerave cream on the corn with your fingernails. The corn will eventually come out on its own. At that point, you could continue applying the Cerave cream 4 times a day. The best outcome is the corn gets smaller each time it grows back and over time that it disappears. 

* [Cerave SA cream](https://amzn.to/38PvoLn)- applied to corns (or where the corn was) 4 times a day.


* [Therapaw boots](https://amzn.to/2Yzl08I)- size TD, used for every walk on front two paws. Note they are sold individually. We use [newborn socks](https://amzn.to/3E02zKR) underneath with a small hole made for the dew claws to prevent rubbing. This has stopped her limping and made her much happier to walk. [Hunnyboots](https://hunnyboots.com/) are a stylish popular alternative. You could try UK suppliers, [Zoomadog](https://zoomadog.co.uk/products/799-hunny-boots-v3-set%C2%A0of-two/?bc=no) or [Pointy Faces](https://www.pointyfaces.co.uk/sighthound-boots). The shipping was slightly cheaper with Pointy Faces when I checked.

Using the above method, we managed to get right paw corn much smaller. It started out as big as the left paw corn, which we are continuing to work on albeit with slow progress.

Possibly helpful:

* [Epsom salt](https://amzn.to/3yUR7w2)- many people soak their greys' paws in epsom salt solution for several hours, then hull the corn out using [dental tools](https://amzn.to/3BQoSAv) or a [root elevator](https://amzn.to/3jYxzD3). We've tried this as well but didn't notice much difference between soaking in water vs salt solution. Perhaps this depends on the salt concentration and ours was diluted too much. 

We've also tried many remedies which failed, including:

* [Colloidal Silver 20 ppm](https://amzn.to/3yR1pNK)- observed no effect.

* [3M silver duct tape](https://amzn.to/2WViN6M)- this was useless because it would not stay on for long. [Gorilla tape](https://amzn.to/3yLL8K0) worked better but slips and moves off the corn. 

* [Musher's Secret](https://amzn.to/38RXplq)- this moisturises pads temporarily but doesn't seem to affect corns.

Untested remedies:

* Nail Polish- some people apply this on the corn possibly to dry it out.

Update- 2021-09-13

Our grey saw the vet for her annual check up. This vet is known to be experienced with greyhounds and she seemed pleased with her corn management and said that the corns were softened! When she took her in to examine her, she ground them down slightly below the surface as she thought the cream might get in deeper if she did that. We will continue with the Cerave regimen. Our hound's back two paws have started to form one corn on each paw. She hadn't been wearing boots on her back paws on walks because it wasn't necessary until this point. Now she will to prevent the corns from getting worse. For the back, Therapaws didn't fit the paw shape well (TD or TC sizes), so we will try Hunnyboots (size Medium). 

Update- 2022-08-08

Over the past year, she has continued to wear the Therapaws on her front paws, but the corns have repeated returned. We don't think it's possible to get rid of them as long as the mechanical pressure persists. We manage them using the soaking/hulling method. The ideal time to remove them is straight after a walk on a wet day. We've been using [dental tools]((https://smile.amazon.co.uk/HOKIN-Remover-Cleaning-Filling-Stainless/dp/B08DNZWR33/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2F368C2KY5UK9&keywords=dental+tools&qid=1659952007&sprefix=dental+tools%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-7)) to help remove the corns and after we apply [Cerave SA cream](https://amzn.to/38PvoLn). So far, she has not had issues walking with regular management. Fingers crossed!

An update on her back paws- we've similarly removed the corns twice in the past year when they started to protrude but they are relatively small and do not appear to bother rest of the time. She is more sensitive about her back paws and dislikes wearing the hunnyboots so she has been wearing boots on front paws only. The therapaws have been very reliable and she walks well in them but now they are starting to wear out with holes developing by the toes. Due to the pandemic, we have had trouble sourcing replacements but we've been told by the manufacturers that they should become available mid-end August, 2022. Some UK suppliers are shared below:
