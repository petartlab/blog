If you live in the city, your grey will end up walking on sidewalks and paved roads. Because they are used to walking and racing on softer surfaces, greyhounds seem to suffer from various issues with their paws once they are rehomed, such as cuts from glass, foreign objects getting embedded, and corns. We use these to keep our hound's paws as healthy as possible:
