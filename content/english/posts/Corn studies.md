Our battle with corns continue but our hound doesn't appear to be suffering with our current regime of hulling and boots on walks. 

Recently I watched a very helpful webinar held by the wonderful [Greyhound Health Initiative](https://greyhoundhealthinitiative.org/). The GHI is a very helpful resource if you are interested in your hound's special health needs. They are the makers behind the well known blood value cards that help owners and vets correctly diagnose sighthounds as they have different blood chemistry from most dogs. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_15t1RdIw&ab_channel=GreyHealth) is the webinar that was held by the GHI and Dr. Richard Doughty on recent findings about corns and the tendonectomy procedure. 

In case you are near Liverpool and want to contribute to ongoing research, there is corn research study that need participants. You can find details [here.](https://greyhoundhealthinitiative.org/ukresearch/)
